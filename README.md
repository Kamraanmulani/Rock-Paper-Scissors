# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a fun game where two players choose between three things: rock, paper, or scissors. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Each option beats one and loses to another. Players make their choice at the same time, and the winner is determined by the rules. It's a quick and easy game that anyone can play!
